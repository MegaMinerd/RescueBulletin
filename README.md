# RescueBulletin

## Installation
This program requires Java 11. Download the latest JDK or a JRE that supports Java 11. Don't forget to update your system's PATH variable.
## Features
* Ability to edit and randomize PMD: Red Rescue Team (US/Aus)

## Goals
These are in order of importance
* Achieve data shiftability by completing and integrating SbinFile, SiroFile, SiroSegment, SiroFactory, and ConfigHandler
* Ensure that data currently viewable is accurate and savable. (This is best done second in case the first step breaks something.)
* Import and convert code from precursor script viewing tool. For now, it will be diaplayed as raw data annotated with current understanding to assist in verification and further reverse engineering.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. The currently most desired assistance is the script system and the comment beginning on line 29 of minerd.relic.util.CompressionHandler.
