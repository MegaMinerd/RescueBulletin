# RescueBulletin

## Installation
This program requires Java 11. Download the latest JDK or a JRE that supports Java 11.
Run it through a JDK. The best of my googling suggests the JavaFX packaging tool has not been supported for years and no longer works with current versions.

## Features
* Ability to edit and randomize PMD: Red Rescue Team (US/Aus)

## Goals
These are in order of importance
* Achieve data shiftability by completing and integrating SbinFile, SiroFile, SiroSegment, SiroFactory, and ConfigHandler
* Ensure that data currently viewable is accurate and savable.
* Import and convert code from precursor script viewing tool. For now, it will be diaplayed as raw data annotated with current understanding to assist in verification and further reverse engineering.
